The type of data we collect.</b>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10.5pt;">
		"Personal
data" means data that allows someone to individually identify you,
including your name, email address, and other non-public information related to
or linked to any of the above information. "Anonymized data" refers
to data that is not personally related to you, including aggregated data and
de-identified data, and anonymized data itself does not allow identifying
individuals.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
		<br />
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10.5pt;">
		We collect personal data
and anonymized data as described below:

	<p class="MsoNormal">

	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10.5pt;">
		A. The information you
provide to us.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
		(1)
We may collect your personal data when you use our services, update your
account profile, or contact us, such as email address, first and last name,
username, and other information provided by you. We also collect your
blockchain address, which may be associated with personal data when you use our

	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
		(2)
Our services allow you to store preferences, such as the content of the
presentation, notification Settings, and favorites. We may associate these
choices with your ID, browser, or mobile device.

If you provide us with feedback, we will collect your name and information, as

		B. The information

	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10.5pt;">
		When you browse and

you, including but not limited to your browser type, operating system, Internet
protocol (" IP ") address, mobile device ID, blockchain address,
wallet type, and date/time stamp.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10.5pt;">

most websites and applications, we automatically collect some information and
store it in log files. This information includes IP address, browser type,
Internet service provider (" ISP "), reference/exit page, operating
system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use these information to
analyze trends, manage services, track the movement of users across services,
and better tailor our services to the needs of users.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10.5pt;">
		(3) the Cookies. Like
many online services, we use cookies to collect information. We can use session
cookies (which expire after you close your web browser) and persistent cookies
(which remain on your computer until you delete them) to analyze how users
interact with our services, improve the quality of our products, and provide
users with a more personalized experience.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10.5pt;">
		(4) Pixel Tag. We use
"Pixel Tags" (also known as clear GIFs, web beacons, or web bugs).
"Pixel Tags" allow us to analyze how users find our services, make

	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10.5pt;">
		(5) Analysis services.
In addition to the tracking technologies we provide, such as cookies and Pixel
tags, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you
access our services. This includes third-party analytics services ("
Analytics Services ") that we participate in to help analyze how users are
using the service. The information generated by cookies or other technologies
about your use of our Services (" Analytics Information ") is
transferred to the Analytics Service. The analysis service uses the analytics
information to compile reports on user activity, which we can receive
individually or in aggregate. We use the information we gain from analyzing our
services to improve our services. Analytical Services may also transfer
analytical information to third parties if required by law or if third parties
process the analytical information on their behalf. The ability of each
analytics service to use and share analytics information is limited by the
Terms of Use and privacy policy of such analytics services.

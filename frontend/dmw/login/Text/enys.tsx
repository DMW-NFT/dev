"NFT" in this Privacy Policy means an irreplaceable token or similar digital project implemented on a blockchain, such as the Ethereum blockchain, that uses a smart contract to link to or otherwise associate with certain content or data.

Your Role and Responsibilities: Before using the Software and Services, please thoroughly understand this policy, and confirm full understanding and consent before starting to use. 

Your Rights and options:

(1) You have the right to understand the collection and storage of personal information by the Software.

1. The type of data we collect.
"Personal data" means data that allows someone to individually identify you, including your name, email address, and other non-public information related to or linked to any of the above information. "Anonymized data" refers to data that is not personally related to you, including aggregated data and de-identified data, and anonymized data itself does not allow identifying individuals.

We collect personal data and anonymized data as described below:

A. The information you provide to us.
(1) We may collect your personal data when you use our services, update your account profile, or contact us, such as email address, first and last name, username, and other information provided by you. We also collect your blockchain address, which may be associated with personal data when you use our services.
(2) Our services allow you to store preferences, such as the content of the presentation, notification Settings, and favorites. We may associate these choices with your ID, browser, or mobile device.
(3) If you provide us with feedback, we will collect your name and information, as well as any other content contained in the message.
(4) You may voluntarily provide information to us or collect your personal data from other service points in our statement.

B. The information collected through technology.
When you browse and interact with our services, we may use automated data collection techniques to collect certain information about your devices, browsing actions, and patterns, including:
(1) Information collected by our servers. In order to provide our services and make them more useful to you, we (or third party service providers) collect information from you, including but not limited to your browser type, operating system, Internet protocol (" IP ") address, mobile device ID, blockchain address, wallet type, and date/time stamp.
(2) Log files. As with most websites and applications, we automatically collect some information and store it in log files. This information includes IP address, browser type, Internet service provider (" ISP "), reference/exit page, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use these information to analyze trends, manage services, track the movement of users across services, and better tailor our services to the needs of users. 
(3) the Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.

(5) Analysis services. In addition to the tracking technologies we provide, such as cookies and Pixel tags, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you access our services. This includes third-party analytics services (" Analytics Services ") that we participate in to help analyze how users are using the service. The information generated by cookies or other technologies about your use of our Services (" Analytics Information ") is transferred to the Analytics Service. The analysis service uses the analytics information to compile reports on user activity, which we can receive individually or in aggregate.
